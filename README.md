# Bike-sharing-Project-using-Linear-Regression


This project is based on a bike sharing company which incurred loss due to pandemic and is now aiming to achieve maximum profits . Here we needed to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market
